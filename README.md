# Time Series Modeling of Superstore Sales

As an exercise to practice my time series modeling skills, I did a project to forecast monthly superstore sales only with endogenous variables. At a later time, I may try to forecast daily superstore sales with endogenous and exogenous variables. 

The superstore sales data are from https://www.kaggle.com/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting.
